This is a shader and its hlsl file based off of https://github.com/amirave/urp-terrain-toon-shader/tree/main 's Unity URP custom terrain shader WITH triplanar mapping


The difference with this shader is I added in the toon ramping which makes the shadows looks flat instead of shaded. 
This is very similar to what "A short hike" uses although this works for Unity URP. 
I believe only the ToonTerrainPasses hlsl file has been modified.

I will be making a tutorial on how to use it and show what my settings are very soon on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@BillyBobCletusProductions/videos)

There might still be some issues as I am in no way a shader expert, please feel free to modify and use it as you wish. 

I'm actually using this shader for my upcoming game, and while it does not have a steam page yet if you'd like to get updated on it you can follow me on twitter at https://x.com/billybob_c10781 or bluesky at @billybobcletus.bsky.social


BIG KUDOS to amirave for making the original custom terrain shader for URP, which is a lot harder to do than for Built-in Render Pipeline!



PS: I also have the Built-in RP version of this shader but haven't tested it enough.
